					<h4><strong>Software Development</strong></h4>
                    <p4>The programming language this study guide is focusing on will be Java, so the content here will only be relevant for that. Every programming language is different and has their strengths/weaknesses, Java's strength is it's popularity in desktop and mobile general use software. Don't get this wrong though, most stuff you pick up from here translates really well to other object oriented programming languages!</p4>
					<p4> To get started, you'll first want to make sure you're using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) designed for use with Java. An IDE is basically where all you code can be understood and processed, with many features to assist in your programming and debugging. Without an IDE, programming would be significantly more difficult, let's thank technology! <br><br> I will be using NetBeans IDE, and I suggest you do too, at least for his study guide, as this is typically the most commonly used in the industry.</p4><br><br>

					<h4><strong>Good practice</strong></h4>
					<p4>When coding in Java, and any other programming language, you want to make sure you're implementing good practice within your code.</p4><br><br>
					<p4>What is good practice? Here's the breakdown:</p4><br>
					<ul2>
						<li>Using proper indentation in your code</li>
						<li>Use short but descriptive names for variables</li>
						<li>Use methods wherever you have repetitive code</li>
						<li>Use optional extensions (ex. Prettier) to ensure your code is the best it can be</li>
						<li>Only use global variables wherever it is necessary</li>
					</ul2>

              <div class="sdColourBoxSoftware" style="margin-top:10px">
				  <h4><strong>Variables</strong></h4>
                    <p>Variables are a fairly simple concept to grasp, they're a core piece of the functionality in programming.
						<br><br>
                        In Java, there are 5 types of variables, these include: String, Integer, Char, Float, and Boolean.
                        <br><br>
                        Strings hold text, for example: "Hello World".
                        Integers hold numbers, for example: 57.
                        Chars hold a single character, for example "A".
                        Floats hold floating point numbers, for example: 20.05.
                        Booleans hold 2 things, either true or false.
                        <br><br>
                        To help you visualize what variables are and how they're used, let's imagine them in a real world scenario.
                        <br><br>
                        I can have a variable called "Animal", and I can give it the string "Cat".
                        <br><br>
                        To explain what happened here, I have a box called animal, and I can put the cat in that box, now whenever you reference that box, the cat will be part of it.
						<br><br>
						This is what this would look like in actual Java!:
						<br><br>
						<code> String Animal = "Cat"; </code>
                        <br><br>
                        Try to make your own scenarios, just remember that the variable is the container, what you designate to be inside of it should be relevant to the variable name.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Comments</strong></h4>
                    <p>Comments are used to describe functionality of code without causing the interpreter to react to the text you have written. These are crucial for clear and readable code, especially in teamwork scenarios.

                        to comment a single line of code, you can simply type "//" before any text you wish to input.
						<br><br>
                        
                        <code>//Hello world!</code>
						<br><br>
                        
                        to comment multiple lines of code, you can type "/*" at the start of the text and "*/" at the end!
						<br><br>
                        
                        <code>/*Hello world!<br>
                        This is a multi<br>
                        line comment!*/</code><br><br>

                    <h4><strong>If Else Statements</strong></h4>
                    <p4>When you want to make your code do something depending on a response from something else, this is the way to go. It is worth noting that if there is more than a few choices, it's best to use a switch statement for efficiency. More on this later.</p4>
					<br><br>
                    <p4>For example, if the weather is cold outside, i want my code to display: "wear a jacket", and if it's warm, i'd rather it said "get your t-shirt on!". To pull this off, I'll be using an If statement, typically laid out like this pseudocode:</p4>
					<br><br> 
                    <p4>If Weather is cold Display "wear a jacket" else Display "get your t-shirt on!"</p4>
					<br><br>
					<p4>Here's how it looks in actual Java!:</p4>

                    <h4><strong>Loops</strong></h4>
                    <p>In java, there are there are some cases where you'll need to be using loops, there will make a cycle that can only be broken with certain factors, like if a number becomes more than another or if something changes to true.
						<br><br>
						While loops are set to run while a variable is in expected values, until it falls out of this expected value which causes the loop to break.
						<br><br>
						For example, in a while loop you can use numbers, so while a number is within a value bracket you specify (such as under 5), the loop will continue. Another way to do this is to use Booleans, so that while something is true, the loop will continue.</p>

                    <p4>JoptionPane is a user-friendly module in Java which allows for user input with dialog, input and other kinds of message 		boxes. There are crucial if you wish to build a program that looks professional, and it's typically a requirement in HNC 		Java. With JOptionPane, you need to import the module at the start of your code to start using it, don't forget this!</p4><p4>Check this out!</p4>

                    <h4><strong>White Box Testing and Black Box Testing</strong></h4>
                    <p4>When writing code, you want to make sure it works for its intended purpose, there are many methods you could use to test it, 	but most commonly (and relevant to this HNC), you'll see white box and black box testing.</p4>
					<br><br>
					<p4>White box testing involves testing the program by individual pieces of code, you know what you're trying to test and focus 		on it. Imagine it like this: The box is white, so you can see into it and all of the working components of it.</p4>
					<br><br>
					<p4>Black box testing involves testing the program without focusing on individual pieces of code in mind, you just want to make sure it fully works on the outside when a normal person is using it. Imagine it like this: The box is black, so you can't see into it, you can only see then outer shape and it's general functionality.</p4>
