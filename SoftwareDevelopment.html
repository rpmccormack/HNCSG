					<h1>Software Development (WIP!!! NOTHING HERE IS FINISHED OR NEAR FINAL!)</h1>
                    <p>The programming language this study guide is focusing on will be Java, so the content here will only be relevant for that. Every programming language is different and has their strengths/weaknesses, Java's strength is it's popularity in desktop and mobile general use software. Don't get this wrong though, most stuff you pick up from here translates really well to other object oriented programming languages!</p>
					<p>This week we are working on building the structure of the site and our content&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                    <h1>Variables</h1>
                    <p>Variables are a fairly simple concept to grasp, they're a core piece of the functionality in programming.

                        In Java, there are 4 types of variables, these include: String, Integer, Char, Float, and Boolean.
                        
                        Strings hold text, for example: "Hello World".
                        Integers hold numbers, for example: 57.
                        Chars hold a single character, for example "A".
                        Floats hold floating point numbers, for example: 20.05.
                        Booleans hold 2 things, either true or false.
                        
                        To help you visualize what variables are and how they're used, let's imagine them in a real world scenario.
                        
                        I can have a variable called "Animal", and I can give it the string "Cat".
                        
                        String Animal = "Cat"
                        
                        To explain what happened here, I have a box called animal, and I can put the cat in that box, now whenever you reference that box, the cat will be part of it.
                        
                        Try to make your own scenarios, just remember that the variable is the container, what you designate to be inside of it should be relevant to the variable name.</p>

                    <h1>Comments</h1>
                    <p>Comments are used to describe functionality of code without causing the interpreter to react to the text you have written. These are crucial for clear and readable code, especially in teamwork scenarios.

                        to comment a single line of code, you can simply type "//" before any text you wish to input.<br><br>
                        
                        //Hello world!<br><br>
                        
                        to comment multiple lines of code, you can type "/*" at the start of the text and "*/" at the end!<br><br>
                        
                        /*Hello world!
                        This is a multi
                        line comment!*/<br><br>
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mainArticle" style="margin-top:10px">
                    <h1>If Else Statements</h1>
                    <p>When you want to make your code do something depending on a response from something else, this is the way to go. It is worth noting that if there is more than a few choices, it's best to use a switch statement for efficiency. More on this later.<br><br>

                        For example, if the weather is cold outside, i want my code to display: "wear a jacket", and if it's warm, i'd rather it said "get your t-shirt on!". To pull this off, I'll be using an If statement, typically laid out like this pseudocode:<br><br>
                        
                        If Weather is cold
                        Display "wear a jacket"
                        else
                        Display "get your t-shirt on!"
                        </p>
