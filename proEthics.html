				  	<br><br>

					<p4>Goods need to be described accurately, fit for purpose and of a satisfactory quality.  With regards to services, they need to be delivered with reasonable care and skill. Verbal and written details the seller provides are binding.  The service must be provided in a reasonable time or an agreement has to be made about that.  If the seller doesn't agree a price beforehand then the price must be reasonable.</p4>
					<br><br>
					<p4><strong>Returns</strong></p4>
					<br>
					<p4>Under the Consumer Rights Act if a product is faulty or not as described the customer can return it within 30 days (not including digital products).  If a product fails within 6 months the fault is considered to have been there at the time of purchase.  If this occurs after 6 months then it's on the consumer to prove the fault was there at the time of purchase. </p4>

					<br><br>
					<p4>Members should only do work that they are qualified to undertake.  Don't agree to do a job in an area that you know you aren't fully qualified for, be transparent about your abilities when selling your services.</p4>
